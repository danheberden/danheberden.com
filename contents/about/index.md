---

I work at [Bazaarvoice](http://bazaarvoice.com) as a Senior Front End Engineer. I
work on their [Conversations](http://www.bazÎ»rvoice.com/solutions/conversations/)
product, which is an incredible adventure into third-party JavaScript. I also 
[make things](http://github.com/danheberden).

I also contribute as a board member of jQuery project. No fancy title there 
unfortunately; I just do things to help jQuery stay a happy not-for-profit.

Other than that, I spend the rest of my time doing regular Portland things like
playin dodgeball and kickball, eating at food-carts, and regular things like
hiking, shopping and misc. hobbies. 

And yes, I love beer and all of it that is available in Portland. However, my 
drink of choice is bourbon, neat. Necessary information? Who knows!?
