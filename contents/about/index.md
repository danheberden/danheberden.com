I work at [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com) as a "Open Web Community Developer". In short,
I teach people how to write code \[properly\], organize conferences, and make sure
the bocoup owned websites you know and love are there each and every second you want 
them to be. I also [make things](http://github.com/danheberden).

I also contribute as a board member of jQuery project. No fancy title there 
unfortunately; I just do things to help jQuery stay a happy not-for-profit.

Other than that, I spend the rest of my time doing regular Portland things like
playin dodgeball and kickball, eating at food-carts, and regular things like
hiking, shopping and misc. hobbies. 

And yes, I love beer and all of it that is available in Portland. However, my 
drink of choice is bourbon, neat. Necessary information? Who knows!?
